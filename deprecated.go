// DeleteFunc deletes and returns cache items matched by the filter function.
//
// The item will be deleted if the callback's first return argument is true. The
// loop will stop if the second return argument is true.
//
// OnEvicted is called for deleted items.
//
// Deprecated: Keyset can be used to operate on multiple values. For example
// mycache.Find(func(...) { ... }).Delete()

	for i, item := range keys.Get() {
		// Note this isn't the same as before â€“ we don't have access to
		// Expiration. That's probably okay; it was a mistake this was exposed
		// in the first place.
